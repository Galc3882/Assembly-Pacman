# Assembly-Pacman
An assembly language version of the classic Pacman game for the 8086 Intel processor. This project is a complete recreation of the original game, including all the original gameplay, and graphics. The game is written in pure assembly language, making it one of the smallest and most efficient versions of Pacman ever created. This project is perfect for anyone who wants to learn how to program in assembly language, or for anyone who wants to create their own Pacman clone.
